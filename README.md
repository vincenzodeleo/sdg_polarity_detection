# Abstract

The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally recognized framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and economic challenges. While recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) have enabled automatic classification of textual data relevant to specific SDGs, current approaches primarily rely on binary classification, failing to capture the directionality of impact (positive, neutral, or negative). To address this gap, we propose the novel task of SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such progress. We introduce SDGPOD, a benchmark dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and synthetically generated data. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across five state-of-the-art LLMs, using both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned models, particularly LLaMa-2 13B, achieve high accuracy in polarity detection, with an F1 score of 92.4\%. We further show that data augmentation using synthetic examples improves model performance, highlighting the value of generative approaches for resource-scarce tasks. This work advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity detection systems.
