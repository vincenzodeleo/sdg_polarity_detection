Electronic government guides to increasing citizens' participation and active citizens' development affecting the mechanisms of democracy. Electronic democracy (e-democracy) includes technological innovations that allow improvement and empowerment of democratic institutions with or without the use of internet. E-democracy aims the production of functional democratic processes like communication, information providing and decision-making after electronic public dialogue and voting.
