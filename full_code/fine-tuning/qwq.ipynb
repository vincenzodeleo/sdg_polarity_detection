A major strand of the ensuing debate has focused on the scope of this safeguard. Many academics have argued in favour of according to the presumption a substantive- as opposed to a procedural-role. In otherwords, these scholars maintain that the presumption set in art. 6(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should have some influence on the definition of criminality. Courts seemsympathetic to this approach, albeit not following it to the full extent. The article, instead, defends a procedural understanding of the presumption of innocence, on the basis of interpretive arguments concerning art. 6(2) ECHR. Besides, it shows that adopting this conception does not entail lowering the protection of the individual before the substantive criminal law.\",\n          \"There are no seating arrangements for the women at the Upazila Parishad offices, and they are rarely allowed to play a role in development activities in their area. The Upazila Parishad (Reintroduction of the Repealed Act and Amendment) Bill 2009 does not include any guidelines for the new posts. In the Union Parisad, proxy representation exists, which means male members of the family represent women Union Parishad (UP) members and many husbands help their wives with their work in the Union Parishads (Nazneen and Tasneem 2010). Many female members have participated in shalish (a social system for informal adjudication/justice) and many of them have presided over the shalish sessions. Various non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and women's organisations training programmes that focus on alternative dispute resolution and human rights, support creating space for women to participate in these shalish. Women in Bangladesh feel more comfortable discussing issues like marriage, divorce, domestic violence, dowry or polygamy with the female UP members.\",\n          \"Governments have a key role as platform and broker, as stimulator, incentiviser and enabler, and they can focus resources, set a facilitative policy climate and use accountability and reporting to encourage new practices. Governments can support the shift in paradigm by setting ambitious goals that foster innovation, providing opportunities for autonomy, choice and competition, empowering agents of change, encouraging risk-taking, and rewarding and giving exposure to success.
