A major strand of the ensuing debate has focused on the scope of this safeguard. Many academics have argued in favour of according to the presumption a substantive- as opposed to a procedural-role. In otherwords, these scholars maintain that the presumption set in art. 6(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should have some influence on the definition of criminality. Courts seemsympathetic to this approach, albeit not following it to the full extent. The article, instead, defends a procedural understanding of the presumption of innocence, on the basis of interpretive arguments concerning art. 6(2) ECHR. Besides, it shows that adopting this conception does not entail lowering the protection of the individual before the substantive criminal law.\",\n          \"There are no seating arrangements for the women at the Upazila Parishad offices, and they are rarely allowed to play a role in development activities in their area. The Upazila Parishad (Reintroduction of the Repealed Act and Amendment) Bill 2009 does not include any guidelines for the new posts. In the Union Parisad, proxy representation exists, which means male members of the family represent women Union Parishad (UP) members and many husbands help their wives with their work in the Union Parishads (Nazneen and Tasneem 2010). Many female members have participated in shalish (a social system for informal adjudication/justice) and many of them have presided over the shalish sessions. Various non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and women's organisations training programmes that focus on alternative dispute resolution and human rights, support creating space for women to participate in these shalish.

For example, the former grade 12 standardized social studies examination has been replaced by a project-based assessment model developed in Nunavut to facilitate student assessment that combines local topics, cultural content as well as 21st century skills. The concept of Sami education differs throughout the area. On the Norwegian side there are two national curricula for the basic education 1-13, the Norwegian and the Sami. The Sami school concept for grades 1-10 reflects groups, classes or schools which are municipally owned and which follow the Sami National Curriculum, several specialized Sami schools, and for the upper secondary level two state operated schools. Also, all students are required to learn about Sami themes according to syllabi grades 1-13.\"\\nSDG_CLASSIFICATION: \"SDG-4\"\\nOUTPUT: <|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\npositive<|im_end|>\\n'"

            "**decrease in domestic material consumption:** a decrease of 11% in domestic material consumption in oecd regions is positive, as it suggests a reduction in resource use and potential environmental benefits.\n",

            "**increasing extraction worldwide, especially in briics countries:** this is a mixed signal. on one hand, increasing extraction suggests greater resource use, which could be negative for sustainability. on the other hand, briics countries are often developing economies that may be improving their infrastructure and standards of living, which could be necessary for their development.\n",
            "\n",
            "**metal ore extraction keeping pace with economic growth in oecd area:** this suggests that, despite some decoupling in consumption, the extraction of raw materials is still growing in line with the economy. this could be seen as negative for sdg-12, as it indicates continued growth in resource extraction, which may have environmental costs.\n",
            "\n",
            "overall, the text presents a mix of positive and negative trends with respect to sdg-12. however, the task is to assign a single label: positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
            "\n",
            "given that some regions are showing decoupling and reduction in consumption, which are positive signs, but there is also ongoing growth in extraction and consumption in other areas, which are negative, i need to weigh these factors.\n",

            "\n",
            "let's analyze each point in the context of sdg-12.\n",
            "\n",
            "first, informal recyclers risking their health while collecting recyclables. this suggests that there are unsafe practices in place for recycling, which isn't in line with sustainable and responsible production patterns. it implies that the current system is not protecting the health of workers, which is a negative aspect.\n",
            "\n",
            "second, animals grazing on landfills and absorbing pollutants that eventually affect humans. this indicates environmental contamination and health hazards, which are against the goals of responsible consumption and production. so, this is also negative.\n",
            "\n",
            "third, the control of waste exports and imports through the basel convention. the basel convention is an international treaty designed to reduce the movement of hazardous waste between nations, particularly to prevent transfer to less developed countries. this seems like a positive step towards responsible waste management and adherence to international regulations, which aligns well with sdg-12.\n",
            "\n",
            "so, we have two negative points and one positive point in the text. however, i need to consider the overall impact and tone of the text.\n",
            "\n",
            "the first two points highlight serious problems related to waste management: health risks for informal recyclers and environmental pollution affecting human health. these are significant issues that undermine the goals of sdg-12. the third point, while positive, seems to be a regulatory measure that is in place to control waste movement.\n",
            "\n",
            "given that the first two points describe negative impacts on health and environment, which are central to sdg-12, and only the third point mentions a positive regulatory action, i would leans towards classifying this text as \"negative.\" the negative aspects seem to outweigh the positive in this context.\n",
            "\n",
            "but, to be thorough, i should consider if the positive aspect is significant enough to tip the balance. the basel convention is an important international agreement, but in the context of the text, it's presented more as a regulatory framework rather than a success story. it's mentioned in the context of controlling waste exports and imports, which might imply that there are issues with waste trafficking that need to be managed.\n",
            "\n",
            "therefore, overall, the text seems to be highlighting problems related to waste management and recycling, with only a minor mention of regulatory control. hence, the classification should be \"negative\" because it points out significant challenges and negative impacts on health and the environment, which are contrary to the goals of sdg-12.\n",

            "\n",
            "4. **regulations adopted by rfmos**: rfmos (regional fisheries management organizations) play a crucial role in managing fish stocks across national boundaries. their regulations to implement effective measures against iuu fishing directly support the goals of sdg-14.\n",

            "\n",
            "this is pretty straightforward. it's saying that deforestation, especially in tropical forests, is leading to carbon emissions. that's negative for sdg-15 because deforestation harms forests and releases carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "third part: \"furthermore, net capture by land ecosystems was estimated at 0.7 gt of carbon ± 0.8 gt of carbon, but this was considered mainly the result of an increase in forest stock in the northern hemisphere (kobayashi, 2005: 30).\"\n",

            "\n",
            "let's consider a few points:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **territoriality of laws:** the text emphasizes that immaterial property laws are strictly confined to their country of origin. this could be seen as strengthening national sovereignty and the authority of local institutions to govern their own affairs. from this perspective, it might be considered positive for sdg-16 as it reinforces the role of national institutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **exclusion of foreign laws:** the text states that within a territory, the application of foreign immaterial property law is excluded. this could be seen as a way to prevent conflicts between different legal systems, which might otherwise lead to confusion or injustice. by maintaining clear boundaries, it could contribute to a more stable and just legal environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **jurisdiction linked to applicable law:** the fact that jurisdiction is functionally linked to the exclusive sphere of applicable law suggests that courts only handle cases based on their own national laws. this could be seen as a way to ensure that justice is administered consistently and that judges are applying laws they are familiar with, which might lead to more fair and reliable judgments.\n",
            "\n",
            "however, there are also potential negative aspects:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **limitation of access to justice:** if a person's intellectual property is being infringed upon in a foreign country, and the laws are strictly territorial, it might be harder for them to seek justice across borders. this could limit their ability to protect their rights fully.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **potential for inconsistent laws:** different countries may have different standards and protections for intellectual property. if laws are strictly territorial, it could lead to a situation where similar cases are treated differently in different jurisdictions, potentially leading to inequalities.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **lack of international cooperation:** strict territoriality might hinder international cooperation in combating intellectual property infringements, such as piracy or counterfeiting, which are often transnational issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "given these points, i need to decide whether the text as a whole implies or explicitly states that what is affirmed or described leads to a significant advancement in favor of or against sdg-16.\n",
            "\n",
            "the text is descriptive and analytical, explaining how immaterial property law is treated in terms of territoriality and jurisdiction. it doesn't explicitly state that this approach is good or bad for justice or institutions. instead, it seems to be presenting an observation about how these laws function within the legal system.\n",
